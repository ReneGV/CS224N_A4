You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like <unk> or with clothing and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that fell into you.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school at the middle school, in the middle school, in Ohio of Ohio where I was the weird class.
When I was going to take it up to me every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the front room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who struggled with AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know it.
You could take it to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to stand with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the data, and we got out of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them to my <unk> <unk> about 60 meters. And I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Every iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold themselves up to the end, while others can't afford more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and themselves, in large measure as we see us sometimes as a humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I am breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts a iceberg releases rich freshwater on minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in this way and not going to exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of his way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are an iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to actually get to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
So this is an open-source iceberg <unk>
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X <unk> joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my ground activity will turn two <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of cyberspace.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluid -- the idea of <unk> what has thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much longer than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics field doesn't fit in the male and male <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the ordinary forms or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life of <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receivers for testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk> course.
When you go to the baby it has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a little girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.
After making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women like men, like men, have in the body something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman <unk> he doesn't know their <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me have the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as a <unk> he had girlfriend, and she had a life like a boy and I had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk>
I had 20th chromosomes and the <unk> the <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk>
And it was at age 19 when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, he was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- you have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why it happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get involved in various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that it's being woman is to have a <unk> identity -- to be black to be black wants to have African anatomy in <unk> terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when it shows us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture with <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very similar.
Imagine how amazing to have children are born like two people in a body.
The most high case last year is the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in cloth in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called it to ask, "What do you test to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact that <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we need to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose and if it was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract an eye organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determine really the death of somebody. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be someone like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> <unk> to the people with unusual bodies but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than we thought of <unk>
<unk> from the concept of a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of the father <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every single one of you seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with all of them <unk>
The father <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I tell you why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody believes -- what we <unk> our dad <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of memes, right?
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right idea.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came into the political power by the law of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then to the son, etc.
The father <unk> rejected that idea, and they sell it for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
And it was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the story of Los Angeles -- that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being transmitted by a vague idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of school, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And on a consequence they were spreading the idea of the <unk> concept.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundation of the future movement of Human <unk>
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color people who are going to be <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the stage, we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we were going to be able to do this, in order to do this.
I don't want to say that at five years of five years of them should be allowed to have sexual relationships.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, especially was born three months before time, June 1 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, was born the March 1 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right right to the sex consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered to be <unk> from the <unk> of which Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Do you feel for their part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome -- and that to marry a woman you have to have a chromosome chromosome.
Now, in practice do not make tests <unk> people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I am going to get a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of your <unk> going beyond today's century.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do we judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> smart decisions.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which one man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to engage a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that had done a couple of years ago that had made birth twins <unk> and then pick them up and get her <unk>
But when the phone asked her to ask the operation of the operation he was a very <unk> operation, I told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, have been considered the political <unk> rather than separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are without <unk> to change for the <unk>
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to end I mean, I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in the graduate school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in feminism -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
feminism has to do with getting rid of the stereotypes about gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I have thought about that there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to social social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very familiar to find the way to protect people over the state, it is possible to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when you get to the most of the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year of 2007 I decided we had to <unk> how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where he wants to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new purposes.
Well, at this point we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than its building cost.
So we could easily take it to the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just put it out by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments are already owners and the other half is still in order to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are surrounding them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartments building up and always and when the rules of that place <unk> the building instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments were going to be able to build new development areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk> cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 20,000 <unk> would come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next election <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where they <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
In the meantime, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of trials with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and measure all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They named me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> <unk> in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country will go forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk again four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that you want to do at least 1,000 miles square.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option from a city to which you might go and be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North Korea.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help of <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> actually will be <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could take a thousand square miles.
And shortly after that, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional available to create these special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this <unk> <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of them are <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed over another <unk> of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> was at the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that's building in Korea <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> and then it would allow it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the court of the last time for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have been solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that would like to be able to grow in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people that would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job, sometimes they have a young mothers who have to win the money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, lastly, and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog <unk> and <unk> and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to meet people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I will like the color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive -- then I feel that I've won.
Back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings to somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothing.
It's inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after getting to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walking for TED in <unk>   That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound <unk>
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You almost always can see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, you don't just be <unk> you will also be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the boy who are in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like to play the <unk> or I remember it to your little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you're not good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We should be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very nice way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people were approaching this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some things out.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally at these things, because back in the corner, there's always going to be another crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and check it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side -- which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you get a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who's completely logical here.
This would be someone who's totally intuitive.
So where's your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of the extreme ones, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We set up with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that may have developed with the time of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just at a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and he didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar of parking bar taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point I found the physics a few years ago, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of mechanical mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer computer.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit of the center.
And then here we do a very large approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little bit of metal, a way of springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know what uncomfortable that is being on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I leave you from doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The friends with inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal you will behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to take all the other hair.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then they put it at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was sure, and the way it was <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Actually, really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you like <unk>
I mean, it's my logic that we talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when you get it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually very quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is about that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep complexity of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art that is here and allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and he took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explained just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
I better show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've made from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around there, and they were <unk>
You want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the plane on the top, and with one click, we jump in.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the room.
Don't go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million of them.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixel here.
It can zoom in around very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I came up with something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I found that kids were actually playing something.
I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is going to come, a second.
So now we're going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van <unk> actually created this work <unk>
It goes up and true that we got it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple -- we go on -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a click around.
It's about "The National Gallery in London.
You can write things -- send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel by contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, I don't think they don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to your work of art and it's represented online online.
And the great question that I do today is, "You have to do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it architectural design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from rural origin -- all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting about the racing racing in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of mine -- one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, is <unk> control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic electronics.
They're getting into the open air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the emissions of CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year at <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
So in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms were going to come back.
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Miguel <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the <unk> and he threw it up to the Moses -- -- you can still see a little dent of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capture the environment and something going on.
So let's start with the detection of the wild.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of the summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy, won the World Cup World Cup
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the Earth's activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the River <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
And so early there are people over here and there making <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Does Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the first minister of then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age of <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the background of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a bakery -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its shift in its change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of us will <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with less energy.
These are data that hasn't existed.
There are complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think we think is that if we see every day that the cup that we have -- that is still somewhere on the planet, that is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that is still still there, still still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is happening on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a garage, was to imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels -- you can write in them, I'm going to show patterns, images, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And we had a commission to design the building of <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows, no windows, but when you get coming up to you that you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is over, like this case.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but that when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
You see people <unk> so it goes on it.
And here I'm myself just trying to do not <unk> when you test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to leave you, but a building that kept making <unk> and holes from water and one had to jump for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and from projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in <unk>
Could we form this cloud, we could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or a normal one, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a entry that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of mind today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it all a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last two years, is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world in the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be, we can turn out of the digital world from the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or emissions of CO2. How will we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people be involved in doing this together, very collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud of cloud are the bottom.
This is a physical structure in London, but covered in the bottom.
You can move over inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom to share the main moments of the Olympics.
So, it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who's going to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
They would like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
How about good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would do <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Oh, most of them, that makes me feel very well as a medical doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference. but I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called nothing in biology -- it makes sense of <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take us in the smallest gut than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think ... when Antonio <unk> gave them the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we are going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without effort on their part.
It's really like a quick way to the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk>
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom like one single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- each cell are just divide and all the genetic power of that cell is added to the two daughters.
But when organisms come together, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a university student, I thought, well, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that even <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, it finds a gorgeous light <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, says, George, says, "I pick the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to regain the health of the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden into the next level, and then we'll let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us would take the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily help longevity.
It doesn't necessarily allow the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the more intelligent and even more smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish in the empty fish, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And, by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce a evolution of the traditional natural type, driven by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the importance of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we were <unk> when we were <unk> distant planets are going to exist to the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution <unk>
But there's a third possibility -- an intriguing possibility -- intriguing and terrifying possibilities.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but is what you pick up individual and familiar.
So think that if it could be able to be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic uranium to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
They wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of going on, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 or a week.
Not much for us to make the human genome actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more in the scope of all.
These are those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only being protecting themselves but they're going to spread against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine, which is in cells of a HIV plant.
You can imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life to remove diabetes, eliminate the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to turn the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options on a way of a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose the different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're to 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane filled with smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk to the flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot was already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is the plane with the Hudson River.
It's often not the way.
They put the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
I heard the three words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to do with all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned is that day -- and this is while <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought I feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my errors I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave myself to my <unk>
And I'm sorry for the time that it doesn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mind is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I had a sense of it, I had the feeling of, "Are you going to die no fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I found myself <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You know, you're flying around today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing about your airplane -- and please not be like this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you might expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are going to be.
Thank you.
So clearly I've been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and you have a good good thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody to see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they are going to give you to the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there at that very precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much in your inner can't afford it.
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- that they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer that's about that and record the negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First they start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that we could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get a email email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world -- all of the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something totally stupid and when they were going to have taken the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought at the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it on a LED light, and there's now a device that is free -- and that's free -- we published the code <unk> the software goes down in a free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital that I can say to say.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of the intense sessions of all night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system of their life.
We <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking wall outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to go on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way that is our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk with this.
This is a great device but it's the equivalent of a standard, <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential that deserves a lot more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, in December, the Time magazine recognized as one of the world's greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what you have in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, which was nothing possible at a moment.
Do you get any thing in this room.
Now I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to do every day when we find ourselves with something that I feel that you need to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to the difficult.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It was in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to try.
So when I knew that I would come up here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you can have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I had the name of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in your face, especially if I put it in a ridiculous or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy your name.
If I would have asked me a year ago, he would not have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could <unk> anything that was so difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The biggest movie <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that all over at the bottom -- in beginning to the end, has a brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the murder of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure it was going through all categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you put a shoe and you get the shoe as a lot of <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The biggest movie that you have ever been <unk> the best drink that you've been <unk> from "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That is the full idea, all the <unk> beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big pages.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be understood.
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS:
So, I need to tell you, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what 15 percent.
MS: Yeah.
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant to have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to count with that new vehicle worth of attention that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>     -- this is one of the first images that are going to happen.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey Sergey No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the <unk> the <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to actually make it really change.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the businesses and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want them to say <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but you know, <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me into some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to, like, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to get out of the <unk> and go to business myself with my whole team.
So what I started to see is all of a sudden, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films make big, giant movies and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies <unk>
And the film is called "The biggest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you just cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you that you get off.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> for <unk> to <unk> in the shelf like it.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little brand a little brand.
<unk> to the kind of films that are <unk> we are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that you have other percent.
So do things like this, you know, remind us to remind people is the reason that this interest us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think it's a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times a <unk>
Things like the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man on the street, people like me, to <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the <unk>
Woman: We revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique -- <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like this.
Usually I carry a lot like <unk> or I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan outside a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am. I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of the <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the guy from the pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is made up because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk>
That's what?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> I can often be <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These are <unk> my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I believe that your world is the world where you were doing the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case in my case come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
Sometimes how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
AT: Tell me of the <unk> to what does that cause us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important to <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> you've <unk>
I don't have to be afraid of what kind of mountain mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
AT: Thank you for your nerves -- <unk> Big <unk> hey, <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of <unk> but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk>
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that they are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them to teach them and you make them become a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
So what other brands are you?
The first here is classical Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and your conscious brands -- those things that have been and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is something fairly powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your body identity, your eye eye, what would it be?
You're a <unk> attribute -- you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or you are rather a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful -- it's going to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious as a <unk>
You're there, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
Are you <unk> stable, familiar, sure, sacred <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they would not have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI centers to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a film to film.
We went to San Diego, where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there is nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are going into the way in schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I have had the biggest answer or in which I've been more successful in the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these slides did.
<unk> the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no good interest in mind.
I'm going to talk directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you get there, they were <unk>
Well, since the film was presented in the <unk> Festival take a look.
According to <unk> the film was <unk> in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain power.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about to their customers won't be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people of that is pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees on loss of risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we get forward, I think we need to give them the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear.
At the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix of TED, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for the next year.
The idea behind the worm computing worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop computer using an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> go into the gray box -- hurt the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started to research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these things, and these <unk> systems.
That called us attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they have very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory in the lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, say, for example, a energy plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
I better <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> with people that obviously had all the internal information.
We were all the points for the one to attack.
They probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much to the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking for at first were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we were trying to engage with the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about decision-making that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to figure out the digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to look at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in your hands.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out of a lot of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead dead, and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be on one and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're really confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There's the gray box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provide code -- which is still running on the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> at the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam steam goes on speed, you have to open from escape in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can go off.
And not the <unk> or the security system.
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this load with a <unk> key key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology to <unk>
They were going to get the most possible.
And if you did that, what if you did that, with what is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such a attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
This is the motor behind this is the <unk>
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take you and give it a little bit of <unk> or another thing to do is make you get to get up and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that is put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increases by its speed, and they help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- you can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on his back a load of 45 pounds, and you are <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can <unk> 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now look at the eyes of chairs of the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the middle chairs in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with a very often, very young people with damage to the backbone of their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
And we also talk about the population that will be able to take it very quickly.
His only option, many times -- by brain injury.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury on the column in the column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It's got some sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give you energy to the motors in the <unk> and on your knees, and they make it forward with this soft <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, on the bottom of it <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all the feeling and all the <unk> movement.
Little time later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even set up on a bike bicycle
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just soldiers, but as opposed to all of the users of chairs to all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives are.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot too emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great traditions.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been absorbed for decades and caused almost many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation make it not can fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and, honestly, we are not safe of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind because the relationship of the Bonobo is more than <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you see the game Bonobo sees the roots -- same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human ritual is.
The game is the glue that we come together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild medium.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football game.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because they <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements -- the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think that as it is, sometimes we play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate to play, you can be the moments that it is the most <unk>
For that, classmates for us to take this gift of evolution and play together as we can <unk> creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a fire body.
And in our city, where the volunteers supported a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still, there was a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain of charge and find out what our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her head, and she was <unk> as his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- came up to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog from the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a building on a <unk> building to save a live alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he beat this woman a couple of shoes.
I love it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the fire firemen -- that at that height of the most or less had finished off the fire and walked into the fourth of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
And I took my load back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and a beautiful dog in the front door at the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house of the house of the house where, as it was to expect, his Ma received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house <unk> by the brave effort to save their house.
The kindness that she watched over the rest was that someone had had a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as firefighter being a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also from grace of grace and courage to level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or are you to make a lot of remarkable success levels of success I'd like to remind you about this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in someone's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit of <unk>
You know, food in a dining dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they enter the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block of the concrete block there.
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement in a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the building unit of building in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the homes.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> did it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the labs, the next year, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a <unk> <unk> world to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> <unk> the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are directly to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together by DDT.
So you can't place it in a wrong way.
They have a code of colors.
The green is <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange of the orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble one blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make larger circuits.
One blue one blue with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and we now have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to use it to be connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures to program.
In order to make it faster or faster, you just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection.
We want all interactions in the world are <unk> to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> all must be accessible.
We have given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works at night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronic experience start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk>
<unk> --  a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, "Let's want something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the scope of all.
And so, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the records of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators inventors and collaborators because this world where we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for involved with the environment in focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> just a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better on the video to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I would be hit time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that are supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a bunch of Peace <unk>
I had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of giving them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a New York City <unk>
Here it appears as if I looked at a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone has been caught when it is caught by snow because he knows that it's not very good at putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- a lot of the last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else, that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You create <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component whose thing is, it has a rule.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 apps <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it goes viral.
A responsible for the city systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> to work out of tsunami, but people get broken the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can use using it.
And this has been <unk> without <unk> <unk>
If you know a bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people over two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal channels would have led to at least two years, two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the court of California that until the time has been 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and <unk> <unk> is a kind of warning warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the better government ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without GPS, in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications of <unk> every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> what we do together because they were not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And given that the government in the last time we were coming out of -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the heart of telephone attention and information.
It is the place that the calls of if you make <unk> <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
He went into the basis of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the door to the house, put good music and see if they <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't get that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New Jersey <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually came up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the government of government to collaboration with distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get away and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
connected to two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services to be needed but your neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think you're the entrance to the other.
That our entrance to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will make our values and <unk> our needs.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of 15 feet.
And underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps that that is that we are funded as something that is going on on our loss -- that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work on, we're going to have to make the bureaucracy be sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the motion <unk>
You've got them.
It's a group of citizens that have written a very detailed <unk> report in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have been <unk> in the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't leave with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is about 28 years old, so I am at <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who goes to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of the government they don't really care about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They put the work to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those apps allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out a garbage bucket that has a trash <unk>
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only the consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you there, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it had power.
It was the last word in all the discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good one.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then give me off.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to go back to me again and if I told him I know, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that he had 10 children.
My mother was the smallest of 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and he was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on, <unk> two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, "I will tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> that I didn't do it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just do I want me to take me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> the <unk>
Like I was <unk> to my mom, I said, "Yeah, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yeah, <unk> So <unk>
Then finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I would never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yeah, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern rural <unk> I have a bigger year, and a younger year.
When I was 14 -- 15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just came up with the <unk>
He took a taste of beer, he offered my sister, she took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I'm going to do it, and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I was looking at it with force and <unk> "Oh, you won't be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know that this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it by the power that has identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles killed with alcohol.
And these were the things that you know, according to it, according to it.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest <unk> rate.
We have seven million people in regular freedom.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has changed our world.
In poor communities or <unk> it is so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black people between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or on the regular freedom.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, in 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all the young color people in jail or in regular freedom.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We are looking at our work some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights to always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we <unk> it over the next 10 years, the loss of the loss of rights to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they're sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country prison for kids, no chance to come up.
Right now, we're in process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about to decide whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by error.
In every nine people <unk> has identified one who is innocent that is <unk> and released from death row death.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation that would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine of you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I talk to them about <unk>
I talk about terrorism, the time he started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what they defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks about <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> who grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of race and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've been done.
All the time I would do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> racial without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's rather worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> We have no death row in Germany.
<unk> we'll never be able to have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> we started to run people."
So let's get it about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We wouldn't be able to do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things that are so difficult the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But you know, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of these things.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
If you think of them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
The development of innovation, the development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are also <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at the brilliant and <unk> but also in dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, an will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to inequality, in injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk about it.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> we're going to get together to talk to you.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
So she would say, "Well, and what are you going to do when you were <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> I'm telling me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We're trying to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom of <unk> for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty of death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger in the face and he said, "It's why you have to be very much <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever had.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it is a birth.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that have to be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand issues truly profound about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years, that have been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can an judge convert to someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
And I was very late I was awake for God, if the judge can become something you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a little, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black client in 14 years is treated like a <unk> white 75 years old.
In the <unk> I put that there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
At the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And eventually I got out of the car. I walked out to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He <unk> "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I came up with me and I went down.
And I was <unk> in the ear, and I was <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When you come in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we began to browse.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the policemen the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all right, because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> eye to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
He looked out the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would be a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he showed him, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up and he looked at the <unk> I looked at me and he said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral bow in the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't be truly human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the ones here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your mind, to do something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make an effort to make it <unk> the funding that you spend today in political policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty over the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide -- not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they were <unk> these funds to make the law, the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, small crimes against the property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police gives the gas gas.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk>
And we were talking about social, social <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several <unk> War to <unk> massive <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> Egypt.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting so much more data than the brain is probably <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than to survive, the first stop of all those data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could do harm.
That's why you have a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative stories.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that let's be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world will go wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we received <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good for us to make the problems and the long end of the end of them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
<unk> mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 percent to over 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue <unk> more and higher expectations ...
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, vast part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of a lot of this is the technology -- and we have an exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you can put in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop with any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, social biology, biology, fuels the vaccines and food, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I went through the newspapers the best headline that I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents has happened.
It is not a easy play.
It would be with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the United States is <unk>
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like the <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about threat, but from <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 dollars?
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents the <unk> for hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl English, pointed the Voyager Voyager towards the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is water, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> but also here's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology -- the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen in a conversation with Dean Kamen morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source of any source -- empty water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke has just thought that I'm going to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that we will be, Coke will implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent <unk> on the developing world for the end of 2013.
They <unk> that warrior warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart cell with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody might have predicted before.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music technology technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get into the moment of health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device that you talk, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a medical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the health care and, first of all, stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a whole world.
I call it a billion growing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just spent the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you add up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What would you <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we'll have the biggest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy of Khan and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the budget, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What about these 3,000 billion <unk>
And if you are contributions we can't do it.
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that teams -- guided by his passion with a clear goal, they can do things that could do things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the inside.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors in the other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has been shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be given us to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
In fact, <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it so much until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they are still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying an elimination in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 ft. <unk> <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined in half.
I went back to the five inches at all.
You know, a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was actually imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this very bad boat, it's called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the South Sea Sea, and mostly in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are small spots about some <unk> remains of coral reef.
In short, the sea background came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to be able to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what they collect every time they go to one area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We have the world but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point of start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you take this something like this.
And on the axis and we have some <unk> biodiversity, a number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that are <unk> at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk>
And at the end of the end of the <unk>
And that, in large extent, is what we want to do now.
We want to maintain things that are already not, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when wealthy societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very valuable before we <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose small animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in an synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, it's not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain as a captain -- so I looked at many fish in this area you can't be used or generally they don't use the scientists of fishing fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From the enormous role that can be able to turn a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think about because the starting point has been running and it's highly low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area, and you can benefit from the vision that we can <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West <unk>
I think there are the arts and film -- maybe you can fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay Bay.
A lot of time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do you <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that will give, is how to do <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> a manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are getting viral and what's important to it.
We all want to be <unk>
But now the web video makes any of us or our actions, copper within a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the percentage gets viral is getting infinite <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his home in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the popular rise of last summer.
<unk> is not telling you to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had been published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this argument that <unk> the video to the jellyfish.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present and interesting things and <unk> to a broader audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday, you have to start the ahead --   Everybody wants to come up in the end of week, the weekend.        So I was able to build -- I was going to have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> de Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, I was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask them for those other <unk> they are also built.
But what happened this day, this is in a <unk>
Well, I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a <unk> group will embrace a view of view, and they share with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old version.
And then it became international made.
Suddenly a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script might have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up two days of minute, just and just the only unexpected and unexpected can come up with the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't quite interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> because of the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you out of the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million people see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new thing that we make <unk>
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our <unk> culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media characteristics -- they're just the current media -- but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet a <unk> a man whose entire life was supported by the unique hope of unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long friends, but now we got it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I would have it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when his father died, and a little bit of two little little girls.
To her, life had been meant to a task <unk> the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat belongs to the sea as he was called, <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the tent. rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we were <unk> first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast empty and empty horizon is.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men in our boat, or the motor dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I can remember the lights on the outside platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I end up the journey was too for it, and the first apple I did given for the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is comprised of Vienna.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence -- in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were <unk> among people who had one thing in common. They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a <unk> line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title at <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and that was an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what it was <unk> who was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform was up to the <unk> because I had to last six years old.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
home, where?
Something in me are <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered from all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until their nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> kids stuck with two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and country.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
And in one, it was the classic classical student.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many received through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of mine, they chose the young Australian man in the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges not <unk>
As a <unk> resident of <unk> I was now as far as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the happy life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get back to the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do you not have <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly conversations was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, so many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a <unk>
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is okay to be an unknown way, a new decline in the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept our <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, a optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the people who motto can't be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant <unk> <unk>
<unk> up to the evening.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some brilliant ones, and we open it up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
And then from one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matters.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and carrying the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't make it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, a <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night, a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could you want that to do that?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, to be brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them to make sure they would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
And I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed since the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a cart and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with an airplane.
In that time, when the great Prince warrior warrior Indian, he had <unk> he had a bow and with a bow and a <unk> on the ground, she got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that makes me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed that the technology had to allow the magic to do not <unk>
As my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the luxury of luxury and the cameras prevent them from it.
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I threw it into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books for the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
Can you know how we take the book, <unk>
Where we are.
They bring the text with the image, animation, the sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every day.
And so --  he says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I go into a character of the book.
In several times I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always very exciting.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, light up your way in what the Neanderthal of the book.
Another idea I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy textbook there has always been static maps.
This is a map that goes down, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary again.
These are the <unk>
We all have heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been stuck in Twitter cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a story that comes to current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't been the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, you put a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This way you create a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the relationship between the magic between the magic, Earth and technology, there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we had an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and by reality <unk> you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology will come up with one another.
You have the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we be <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of all, or maybe not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> <unk> because we stop listening.
This is my scale, it's very simple.
It has a passage in and it has changed.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I got up, send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when you need to be <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have over four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it's going to be available from the week to be available from the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to get them from their homes, to take their blood pressure, you get their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to <unk> control and to be ship from their own <unk> but also it can help us care for health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the costs of attention <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video video.
We all have sailing controls in the <unk>
Maybe even we have in our phones.
We know perfectly where are the <unk> <unk>
How are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands, <unk>
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they had already been introduced in the Netherlands in the Netherlands,
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone to find the closest <unk> to find their lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to go back to the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us achieve these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown is still in their place.
Please go into this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera the process of the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a <unk> road <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like dark <unk> and they are, at the time but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say curious, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be, but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
You know, I'm going to have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capture an idea that with capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways they can create something that even seems to be <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like an realistic picture, I think they're those ones that are not even <unk> the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining pictures is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that would find out because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew that I had several months to find them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured by a stone.
And yes, I even made red on the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to get an realistic result, I think it's missing planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result of the result can be very beautiful and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please do if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anybody who took from a mine.
I'm not really interested to show you the details -- but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this is like a lot of others that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology <unk> it's something new.
This is a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights out.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you have technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look like something that would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you were looking at some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it's a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation transport as fast as the past <unk> morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented story in the history of the technological development of economic growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is is -- look at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve, I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think perhaps something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, what is that new way that you take the world?
So what new state is running the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to that transition to <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that they organized those chemists give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories in order to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, it had floating some oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical recipes in their inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time of putting the chemical <unk> and more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They were usually more <unk> they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- very simple, but things get interesting to interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special special called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this mathematical evolution, an writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of dust that I try to hide the people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and put it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things got very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming that cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin, because the bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that in a way, were together in that way, and a <unk>
So it <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community are <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe board into a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no longer without the heart of the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And building very special structures that did not make information more than process in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built in.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible for <unk> and understanding the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> <unk> was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the fact that the nervous system build those information structures enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to be able to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea of <unk>
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and data processing
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape, the <unk> and so forth.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was taken a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The building, the language is, took less than a million years.
And the week, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that makes its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer science.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions of million.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that did not could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is the evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please run a hundred million sequences of instructions to <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at chance, running all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to take numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more close to order to order to order to order to order on.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
And they were going to get those and <unk> to the rest.
And now <unk> the best of the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs that are <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
They put some mutations together.
And he tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in particular cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to show it to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I have the safety of that they get the goal because they come from a hundred thousand programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was going on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to do much faster computers, and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very close to our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give me a part of my fake <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out -- <unk> talk about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that we talked about.
That means that the bat was <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> to the first base, not at the time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, maybe well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who's about 10 <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> <unk> in doing more 400 fibers in a regular season in a regular season of <unk>
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are a surgeon who has also a <unk> record in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a dear thing has two arteries -- <unk> <unk> and his family doctor comes up to a surgeon whose record is <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting better up this year.
And their news has been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
A very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is send them to the world, and I would feel -- with the <unk> of being perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was an Arab student.
Once a fellow in high school, he said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
You know?
<unk> in my little <unk> in the home of the nurses at General member of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the neurological <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to make the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the school of medicine with the impression that if you were doing everything, then it would know everything, or as much as possible, close to everything, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady on the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I gave myself the <unk> service.
And when I was able to go on to I go to a rescue.
And then they report to the head of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides of the side of my heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops going to work and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate everything.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more errors here.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of <unk>
I didn't get the phone and I did what should have been done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that makes a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss without even being able to contact my face.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send them home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner and say, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so sure that until I asked the nurse that I was <unk> to the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if it's going to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then said with total <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he went down the high and the ambulance with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, there.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I was <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that point, I did something that I do not do normally, at the time.
It happened for the emergency service service at home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that I was <unk> from the old lady before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency doctors are.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you know.
He remembers the patient he sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse to complete <unk>
So she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
When I had an hour of having come to his house, after I was giving her the high school, he suffered a gun and his family called the <unk> the <unk> they brought it to the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk>
I was just <unk> and he was blue.
The emergency personnel in their own resources.
They gave up medication to climb blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in a intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days of course it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let her go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks ago, I was inspired by that and I experienced for the first time, the embarrassment that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
Is that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad.
And that felt feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I was doing things and made sure that I didn't get me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little little feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in a <unk> day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I was going to make the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would do it for those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it became going to happen.
Two years later, it was a shot at the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked at him I was a little bit <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin, and he sent him home.
But as he was headed at the door he kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> <unk> my head asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It is an infection, not the iceberg but the upper arm, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until happened over and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation on it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague of a colleague that was looking at the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower left, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I would give him liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I read it.
And I looked at it and to notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I'm going to get away with me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here is the problem: if I can't get up and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go back now to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody to talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones who make mistakes and the ones that can't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we were going to get from medicine to people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've made a personal study of a bad medical reform and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Minister that I wrote for the Star Trek to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the errors happen every day, in which one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where nuclear infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and <unk>
In this country, 24 <unk> <unk> for medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is doubling every two or three years, and we don't have <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on your chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on his chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I got breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, not to be anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of them from the <unk> to the chief of <unk> surgery, this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- <unk> <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell your stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving and support and support and support and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in a time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot of but I am an effort to learn something that can transmit to others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to choose an average American -- are about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot of research on a research week for a week to a group of businesses.
The researchers picked up the different tasks of these executives for these executives and the time that we were going to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more than time.
Now think about their election.
Do you know how many belong to the nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How is it a way that you use those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose in front of the options.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you about how many questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please take a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this level of very, very <unk> level at least at that time was very sophisticated at that time.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water, and this was when you take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf of the oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones who were in the <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit a manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed up the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I put a little bit for <unk> right to the shop.
We put it out there -- six <unk> or 24 <unk> and we look at two things: First of all, what do people were willing to stop by testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had been able to get it out of a 60, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
From the ones who stopped when he had been <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
So they stood up when we had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, we will decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably got <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices will affect us <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this doesn't be <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings today.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about a million Americans, of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding <unk> available in savings plans to convert the <unk> program to save people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, until 59 different options.
We found that the older people was the number of funding funding -- there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme end, we see that in plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the older it was the number of choices, more people are <unk> to avoid actions or investment.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision, the <unk> even when this is going on against the interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you'll see it better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today, less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of rid of strange options, there will be a spike on sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Jobs" corporation took the products to waste of cats that are less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower costs.
You know that the supermarket of today, on average, offer 45 products.
In a grocery store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest frame in the current world is <unk> and it offers only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices that is the argument of David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe of life.
Those of those who are really willing to choose, are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience to this audience with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really reached to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second one, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very well.
Why does people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more at average when it uses credit or credit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make them more positive people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, he <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give you the staff that you would think about the positive things that we were in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a hall of Mars.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two examples.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This is completely useless.
The categories have to tell you something that <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I would say who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about if only the <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the aesthetic complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's make a good decision <unk> the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you have the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and again and over again.
<unk>
If you get a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that the information is.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though you choose the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways we make us for choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building up now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help us handle the <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for people to work.
So I think the key to getting the best of one choice is to be careful to the <unk>
And the more careful the way we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1990s, in the East Germany in East Germany, if you had a writing machine for the government.
I had to record a piece of an example of an example written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written message that you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and turn it into a page, that page will end up having a few yellow <unk> in every page that follow a pattern that makes them one and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what's happening in the online world we can treat the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone, it's very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of the online online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means using illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards, when we buy a computer computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this one has <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen <unk>
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong with worse.
In the future, most crimes in the line.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the protests, they motivate them to motivate them.
These groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national United States, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an extraordinary authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
I would get the safety of the site and run a <unk>
And last week I asked a meeting with elected government <unk> I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority here.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would have an extreme foreign authority of the foreign world.
And they were going to show you the <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the elected protesters the headquarters for the secret police police in April 2011, and during the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 30,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to the governments to make them make this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by British government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They will get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think close to things like these things like these obvious answer should be a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right to be able to do today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cow, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the most of the south, which means that wild animals like the <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions lions -- and this is what they do.
We <unk> our won.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and why we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
The dying are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, from six to the nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the <unk>
I didn't know me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came up the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were like, but the second day, and they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So he went down and killed it.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with that to turn out and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
It was all about it.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give them outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having problems with lions.
And the house houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- male lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to freak out other predators like 65,000 <unk> and it's also being used to collect elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the <unk> of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes fly, and he said that someday I would be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions -- we can be with male lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What is the next one in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented electrical fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, I put it back once, and you know, <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I just got a <unk>  CA: On the bottom Richard Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> at every single step that I was going to take my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of Kim <unk> except that America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything has changed every day.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public support.
But I thought my life in Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When you were doing this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two previous weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very painful.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his face with no power to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Korea died during famine and just a few survived eating grass, insects and forest cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the amount of energy, everything around me was completely dark at night except by sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves the edge between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Africa to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river,
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult but also dangerous, because Syrian refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake report, she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Korea in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Korea didn't get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Korea are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape many other North Korea not so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to get to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We are all <unk> but in inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the test of income to college.
Just when I started to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities <unk> some money I sent to my family, and, as my family was going to be moved to the force to a location outside of the <unk>
They had to run away from immediate immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Korea have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it in a way, for over three thousand miles through China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week and almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked them all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the <unk> border.
After paying <unk> and eventually my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison to short from the South Korea.
I was going to go and come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man say, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care about.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Korea and getting them out of prison.
I would get it to all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when the most <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Korea are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practical language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with familiar contact still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help they help North Africa an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Korea around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores, fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the planners in the city got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles as if this is actually going wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles -- <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a desert desert. The L.A. Southern Center for the food places to take and eat in the car.
And the curious thing is that the food places to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles Southern
For example, the HIV rate in my neighborhood is five times older than that, say, <unk> <unk> who's like 15 miles away.
I was going to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> chairs and sold like cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must be stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of running for 45 minutes and back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters of 45 myself.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it off.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- trees -- you know, nine different vegetables ...
What we do, we are kind of a group they paid ahead of made out of all the <unk> of all the city and completely efficient, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone will be <unk>
The city would come up with me on top and in summary they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, in right?
A court order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody was <unk>  So I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It's four miles of <unk>
That equals 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of plants.
Why on earth does it not look like this?
You get a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of outcome.
This is my <unk> when I tell people, he's growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy to <unk>
I grew up in there, <unk> my kids there.
I'm going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if they leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool for education, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You see how it affects the guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to be <unk> but at his time, I want you to get her <unk>
There was another occasion, where I put a garden in a shelter to <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were all these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how the changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids raise <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you raise climate, they will eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're doing, I see kids from color that are on this way designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block block where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and convert them into <unk>
I didn't get me.
I'm not talking about free, because that's not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people to work with people, pull the kids out of the street, who meet the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You can take your <unk> take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road <unk>
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in the majority of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can go through it, so all the water rain flow goes down to the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and they don't have any water <unk>
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very low, all the noise -- so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see what the damage is in this material.
This is a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you go down, they will be <unk> and they will be separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> <unk> in very small pieces, and we can mix those little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small pieces of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We did a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So we made a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to make a <unk> of trial to try this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test online, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fibers using steel fibers -- bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they can even double the life of the road -- they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's fairly hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repair acts like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember putting it in one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News on his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news usually <unk>
The Taliban were <unk> she agrees my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls illegal to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could tell you where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us who would come in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we were going to make our own lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school became suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan.
But my mother received got mastery.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and girls in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments in which I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you be able to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what you're here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the middle and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate her daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, who I carry on the streets in 1987.
My family believes in me.
I am in big, but my family has even bigger <unk> dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global U.N. <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friends, <unk> for them, despite the case and even in front of an opposition opposition to it.
Like <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter would go back from <unk> to her village, and literally, they were being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> him that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back.
<unk> now, if you were <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk>
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so I think these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future, and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I got it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary revolutionary style of <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the revolution broke up inspired by the wave of massive <unk> and massive revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> they were on the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, they are struggling with freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown an courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and <unk> to the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load of legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved ones, along with many other women, to rebuild the civilian civil society -- <unk> a foreign transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation
There was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with an unique thing, I started organizing workshops about the development of democratic <unk> and leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right of the woman of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> than it was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was safe and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the height of the elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day in the news of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to <unk>
Another day we wake up with the news of the murder of the murder of the military officers ...
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> copyright copyright <unk> and their lack of respect for the law.
Our society, made up by a political mindset, and it gets away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all here today to <unk> with our history of success <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, choose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace, stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated by women's policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, and it will be <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election, that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the consumer representation of the female more than it is going to need to be <unk> and we used to do that.
We need to stop acting as agents of knowledge and call days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion agents and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not just <unk> but also put the reason in the place in the country -- the collaboration in the place of competition, the inclusion instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that have been involved in the war, it desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that led to all of the humanity that men and women, where all the tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so just like the <unk> it covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion all the existence.
This is how you tell us to say to us, "My regret.
So this is what it is like to tell us to say to us about my <unk>
That all of them are given to you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question that has an immune answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all make a <unk> Why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not <unk> no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in the journal <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I believed my soul <unk> <unk> me to your head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
And I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> an trap. hormones of love, where every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I have spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> who would be an Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I've been married about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm wearing a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the religion, all the religion, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only going on in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration or, in the other way, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect or we would expect or we would expect to find a reason why the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be left with a man who cared about it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States in the United States and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence as their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and wildlife night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had a lot of big <unk> like apples, and a hair and wheat, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smarter things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me that was list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why I graduated from that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your partner, so I would try and let my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering a head in a physics, and financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where you go into the scene those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where it was supposed to be so safe to be bought by three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one put it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never been lifted me my hand, my life was already seriously danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the <unk> suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what he had happened, I was sure that we live happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a really <unk> sense for the wedding and the fact that I form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never make any harm.
I spent two times more in our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we <unk> several times against the <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon -- they went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac left to the face.
<unk> followed by one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of every three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time in his life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was picking up of me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help you to deal with their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just don't <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people, because us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the violence in domestic violence occur after the victim has ever put into the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone into married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend the man who would take their mother.
And we still keep asking why it simply doesn't go away.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> I was going to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who I loved so much, would have killed me if he would have killed it.
So I broke the silence.
I said it all over the world: to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and my friends and my family and the whole strangers, and I am here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as headlines like headlines -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people this is a way to say "The fault is by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> officers who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to you and who were going to take their lives and their lives of art and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I got married with a cute man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
The thing that won't go back to ever more, ever is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in somebody who says I will.
Right now, as you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk>
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up in order to end my crazy love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Natural abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
And they had the birth of the birth of the light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
They <unk> his vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims a safe way.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of all the safe safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have dressed like this.  So, I have brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part of it is to pass this shot over the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover me.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much like this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would put her back and put her hair out of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial surgery like the one I made two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our own, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that is my knowledge of heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that you have <unk>  You know, <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told everyone and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> which is less than four percent, not <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would tell you about every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a protein, and it would take it up and gentlemen, which would be awesome as you would be the first.
If you after this spectacular list still <unk> No, no.
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike surgery <unk> can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've got your studies, your studies, and you have a couple of jobs to your backs, no matter what it is, if you want to be <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you're going to get a Model of clothes in for 10 years, people would look very rare.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time he used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I would look at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the <unk> <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not in those photos.
These are <unk> of a <unk> <unk> photographers and photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for you.
I have too many inches at 20 inches and I will never use, except for the previous couple -- but the privilege that I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into red and of course, <unk> and <unk> I'm sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges by my way, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for your aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I think <unk>
When I looked at this talk for this talk, I found out that about 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up at 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you're waiting for is, if you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair and you have the most brilliant hair.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we would get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative creative people, clever and moral people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with a little bit more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be smaller.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs that have the brightest hair and their clothes on the fashion -- but they're probably the most respected women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that I retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> photos and I didn't have the <unk>
There was no <unk> nor <unk> no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk> in light.
In fact, most of them came up at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why do you not take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists they were going to get into the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much it would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we get the same picture, our perspective changes, and my daughter comes to new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> in the grocery store that was <unk> from small <unk>
And he described me what had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who reminded his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things that we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you to all come up in the picture, and you don't have to go back to someone and said, "You get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughter <unk> like <unk> stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept that. You know, why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species.
So why are the <unk> are important -- first of all, provide critical services to <unk>
They're our <unk>
They put the <unk> to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the virus that will not be for them, and it would cause great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge narratives in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the floors and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United States, and the Under Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and he risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the culture of <unk> they do some very important <unk> of open sky in places like employment, there's no place to bury the dead to the dead dead or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a system of natural <unk>
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're going to be, is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> list.
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a minds.
Because there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb for <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are they doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel across different countries, so that you focus on a living problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help. It can become active -- make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you what we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk> <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, they are told about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw the fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
I worked from <unk> to <unk> <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Africa.
And I was <unk>
And I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all of that, everything that we would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where some Italians we decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds in the southern valley to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes into the River River, and we teach the local farm to grow tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were going to take them to come to work, and some times, they weren't <unk>  We were really sure that the local local people, in so <unk>
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not going to do that, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> time to save the people in front of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato would grow this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red and <unk> at night at the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here.  "Why don't you get it? "You're never <unk>
I thought we were just doing the Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, did what the Americans were doing, what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Antarctica.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You know, you can see the <unk> --  <unk> see the waste that we would give to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Western are <unk> energy, <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want to give you a lot.
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white ones in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the soil and said, you can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just respond to people, and I invented a system called the <unk> <unk> where you never begins with anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local passion who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do?
You never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee. We sat together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we were at once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for one time, they <unk> it, but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings with the morning.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity has been <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't even go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with one, and we work on face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor, the business doctor doctor who sets with you in his house, at the table of his kitchen, and it helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this kind of light that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do that? And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
And so I was <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most great business argument in history, he passed away to poems a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of the sector.
So now we were <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer them to privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they were going to come out in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and whatever.
What about the presentation of you have <unk> this tomorrow?
People are <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossil <unk> and from a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a particular story that I read in a recent magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year.
And in the next year, they got together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is continued to grow up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> they were <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that was <unk> New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> medical companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very <unk> <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be <unk>
In another way, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you a absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell to you has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell you with a great financial administration and you have to tell you with a great financial administration, and you have to tell you with a great financial
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 and looked at the 100 icons of the world -- <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one -- no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in coffee -- in bars with <unk> along with their dedicated trustworthiness.
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can find it <unk> Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that he looked for you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't find a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> D.C., and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes at cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief to the giant <unk> who give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It always comes to the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk> --  The city has one of the most beautiful ones in the world, but also one with the highest amount of European properties.
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the time I lived and this was a profound gratitude for time.
It led to the significant things about my current life.
But you know, to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with old people and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases to <unk> before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died to die I want to be <unk>  Before I die -- I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to get it once else."
Before they died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This outer space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving to supporting the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the <unk> we did a kit and now they've done walls in countries around the world, like <unk> Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, is more important than ever, to find ways to maintain the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is short and delicate ones.
The death is something that we often stop talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that are going to tell us more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single question.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old and very <unk>
Don't speech, but it brings joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what the love.
It shares what happens to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice this is never <unk>
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even tell me about one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
Let's get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where each of the songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we did when I was four years old, I would get my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they don't consider it within it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual it becomes a different form of a different way, so that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that quickly increases in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would be among them.
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a kid who saw the world without <unk> a human being never <unk>
Okay.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I would have wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in its interior and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for example, progress and change dies at the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a teacher of communications, that gave a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of fact, <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their great words and words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> should have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I sat down when I had those conversations with the students. It surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care for health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to understand it.
And when you're describing their science care with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make it <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, did Einstein, be as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your work, forget the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he actually inspired the only one of the unique <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we would <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century in the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you look for a public charge of no matter how to sign up or principle, and that, when he gets up, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he <unk> it, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of using the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's a literal thing.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the United States, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some they wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and each other, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
The newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
And what caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
<unk> House didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for if he did not give him or her send her ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than it happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it was just meant to be <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to be serious with a very ridiculous title as a President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that as a government is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- is that the President President of America doesn't sound at all that modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality of the history of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy that has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to do with you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, reality changes much more the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to land under a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that leaves <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive.
As others, I'm wearing a cheap <unk> of light that supports his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that falls down hundreds of feet on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met the control days who lost control and dropped countless feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep side of that hole risking their lives without paying no reward and often dying.
I went home from that hole and went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Peace Peace
Among all the amazing people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is now to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not about a grade.
When we end up talking to me when I was very afraid to speak to me honestly I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> and a stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery began.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even looked at my second home.
But this time, you know, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of the African Africans during all about the <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50 dollars today.
However, today you can see entire families for generations by annual <unk>
amazingly, slavery makes profit from more than 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false <unk> and better work to then find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but the ones that produce them are data.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the <unk>
This strange show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children -- in fact, families -- all of our entire families -- in a heavy equivalent of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads, to 18 at the time, and the lead of the <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made it that I pee out there was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the way, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the Olympics, I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was next to me very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't you do it. Don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worst situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for their release and he trusted that we got it.
As I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles for <unk> <unk> until trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who feed them and the children who are <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to be <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they got entirely their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness of the world to me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I had women who had been previously <unk>
I took me through the stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution in <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to insult customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs by where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big enough enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we play a subject that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even human traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
textiles are another activity that is often interacting with <unk> labor.
I left Indian villages in which there were entire families in which there were whole families in the trade.
This is a family.
<unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of your children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My phone told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to go out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's been estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two younger brothers -- some younger kids, it makes sense of it.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> a lot of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This boy has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of the <unk> trees in Lake <unk> often catch networks and kids, and with fear, you get to the water to unlock the branches.
Many <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it comes to the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when I went back to the latest networks, but they had been working from the one one to a lot of a <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi is what possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her population suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it by a land road to the forest.
At the end of the way, we went out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we started down, we take away the <unk> that we put on the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had tied together to their backs and they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters of <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people carry these heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where you put the stone to get the gold.
At the first sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, at the margin we see to work at other fortunate and also children.
These are all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, her uncle took him to work with him in mines.
By dying of his uncle, I was able to get his uncle, to get his uncle to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines of 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he meant to be released and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a professional possibility that inspired me a lot of respect.
I want to drop light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be an testimony to them and we're going to do everything to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from rights, they're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
So I hope that these images will show a force in whom you see in people like you, and I hope that the force to turn out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematical mathematics, and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are kind of a management model.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I want to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But the judgment of an extraordinary training -- a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component,
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders as the Parkinson's disease would destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years, it's been made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are millions of people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective and ultimately, the only way we will know if you really have a cure will be when we have an objective and objective and <unk>
But it's a frustrating thing that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it, and it's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test of ourselves?
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a kind of conventional form for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string ropes <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to talk to you -- we can imagine as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes we needed <unk> for example.
And as the writers requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom of the bottom you can see an <unk> example of string ropes <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake and trust and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a massive cost of mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the problems that we need to get rid of the patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic in order to protect it, routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make it <unk> mass of cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when we give today the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Global <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> can call it at a price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal for only eight hours.
Thank you.    Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the obvious disease. Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we are looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the real <unk> of the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> of accuracy at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my graduate student -- I have to have a fantastic job and now has been shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, what we would do -- we have an precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York.
We are <unk> <unk>
We are <unk> in the dark, in the room without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make these thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we do the impossible, and we would get away in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real truth for images and photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk> and <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small fishermen village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first peoples affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
They <unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. They took the slime house and leave the homes ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish dead, <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors were found similar things.
They found pictures and shots of pictures and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were born the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets <unk> the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
There were the honor and I had the honor of that day to be able to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and prepared -- I had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I look at the pictures, I found some of them who had over a hundred years -- some of them were still in the back of the lab, and I couldn't stop thinking like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I went on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was as overwhelming and positive and so I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they got some kind of more pictures and they needed more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> a <unk> village in the north of <unk>
Once to the week we use our scanner in the libraries of libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
She could take an hour. It could be a <unk>
It could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using the areas whose color and detail -- the water had no <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these photos were delivered in seawater covered in bacteria, with algae, even with oil, all of that together with the time of time I continue <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean and dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us up with these pictures was kind of lucky to get the photos.
I had started to <unk> her and she was stopped when he realized that <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture, and you put the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared some of their story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble of a lot of where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and knowing that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something I could remember the past of March that would not have been marked on that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to where hundreds of them helped us clean up to clean pictures of <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of photos of completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, a relationship, someone loved somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would have to do, but the first thing you would look for.
This was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger with something larger with something, using their talent for something that are not very perfect skin.
In order to end up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I emailed him the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In the whole world, in the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> was inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition in an exhibition in an exhibition by just a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos on the slow light of light in movement.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing inside of the body without using X-ray and <unk> really defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser laser and I turned it up and put it into a <unk> or a second <unk> to create a package of photons from just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> to travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a bullet bullet than that.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons inside this <unk>
What's what the light looks like?
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in movement.
Coca-Cola didn't have this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light goes on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflection of the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make the same distance and we see it on a slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week, actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie, or a bullet slow in movement.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature looks like a picture, I thought about a <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at more and more you realize that, as the light is <unk> the tomato <unk> they still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether fruit is <unk> without having to <unk>
So why did we create this camera in the interdependent.
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of the <unk> it goes very little light up.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the most short exposure -- so you can just get into something of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible <unk>
And if a new power of a <unk> future, he would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera, and from there to the camera, to the camera,
where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good temporary resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point it corresponds to what a little dot corresponds to what it corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a picture of a picture in the middle, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it in <unk>
This is our ball.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what is around the curve, the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows by the open windows by looking at the light open.
Or we could build <unk> able to see inside the body of your body through <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request to the scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of <unk> in our own generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect each time is not just for scientific tradition, but we can be able to do that we can do.
To create a new form of computational photograph with slow and code code.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going to get away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events in the world are sometimes shown in the camera to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and you give free freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, it will turn to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who of the children have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, a Blackberry, goal.
It's a lot. Almost everyone has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my phone today and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> data lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This tells you that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider every Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at at least six months, and until two years old on their phone company, or their Internet company.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people that came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be the <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany, Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, than please give me all the information that you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah ...
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to do it for a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
You know, the demand and they would send me the information that I was <unk>
In the meantime, the Supreme Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars of information.
At first I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to be <unk>
I want to make a public <unk>
Because I want to show people what the scores of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can come up and step back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other other to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom is talking to you with an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and business agencies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that is not just a fashion.
When you go home, you go home to their <unk> that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that are given to you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi cancer, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi cancer, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral <unk> that's why you spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't afford it.
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one I happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in the present one.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they want to be a <unk>
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> <unk> are at the shopping center, drive in circles for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have the 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold.
I am <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park.
I always loved me that my neighborhood and my disease had the same principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
Many people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters, I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went back to the school system, and it was <unk> that I was also outside and if we didn't take all the last note -- all there was the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk over the five years putting my <unk> on her feet and just walking.
Another gin that I used was just a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a team champion that has received a lot of <unk>
By growing, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arab and still all of the family.  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eat, so <unk> from the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I would spend my summers in a war zone, because my parents worried that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
In summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and put me plastic cups on his back, I was <unk> in the <unk> Sea, and I remember that the water was <unk> and I remember the <unk> and I remember <unk> <unk>
But the cure <unk> was the case.
I have to say it's very boring, but before doing yoga it was a fan of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can see it in the head.
My parents would give this idea that I could do anything that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital Hospital
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the <unk> University of Arizona, because in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet department.
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks at least smart, I took the highest note in my classroom, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with brain <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> In order to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of <unk> At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running into the director of the theater, crying as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because she said it could not make the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the scenes of risk, you can't get the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and they gave him an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability at a <unk>
When I came back home, I came back home, and my first tour <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, he stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors <unk> <unk>
It only comes to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common. They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour he took me famous from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first colony that led when he fell in the realize that he was at high speed for the highway in New Jersey with a <unk> which had brain <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little unpleasant pain that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother with another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and at the time I remind the art directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
It was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I was like invited by invited to the cable show up with Keith <unk>
I went down as if I was to a graduate dance dance to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the CEO and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held out of the news desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't go back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> <unk> and I was wearing my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but never <unk> from me and a little bit older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't get somebody in <unk>
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> <unk> Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
So I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> an organization to give Syrian refugee kids -- a very, very narrow part of what my parents were <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me act alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This town is near <unk>
<unk> drives to the small village to poverty and at the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no future of future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read about a man who offers it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get a brand new money to send them home to their family.
I have a young girl.
He finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky knows, a bomb.
That boy from that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little kid in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for you.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call "the <unk>
And their story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> <unk> in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, for well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them a few opportunities -- the history of the <unk> of access to terrorism, to violence -- will be the story of cities too.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit at <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to be at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I would never have gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a whole personal leaders in a business brand.
I went back to about 90 leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate graduate university university was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from the point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the <unk> system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> against local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some moment to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people will be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and even recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for me, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park of <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their own ideas.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and put in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need -- <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park. This is how it's called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
They gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn to the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and they eat their <unk> innovation and you will have more stories about flowers and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the <unk> <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it will not be on the way that we could -- we almost can pretend we were the first human beings to step back to that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something terrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters with bone hearts with bone <unk> balls of paper <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy to pull what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where do you get the <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash -- to the reason about 11 tons of waste and 2 tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his tissues, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And the <unk> the mechanical <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong -- you will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every single weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of FBI <unk> the gathering of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all the day, and they pass off around you.
They just want to <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the bottom of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always must be on movement.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that the stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the waste <unk> are the most important work in the streets of city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and efficient and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent will threaten us in very real forms.
Control we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of how old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy are starting to fail when it's in danger of the consumption of it.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just read their relationship.
And then it's what I call our daily average speed necessary.
So I mean by what I mean just at the speed as we used to move back in the time.
We usually don't have any <unk> or <unk> or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that you would take out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck on the street, grabbed my little son and I got the stairs on the stairs and he had a man doing his journey of paper paper like doing it all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be good.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste and waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have in account all the cost, even the very real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste we think about when we talk about trash represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
I got a moment to say, thank you.
My work is in the connection to think about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Mexico <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because of the crystals with crystals generates heat in the inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about a weather climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And third, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really obsessed with the old market that is this structure to open air that thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of city growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, put all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the open air in the building that was <unk> by their own shape, and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we inspired us in these beautiful buttons of <unk>
They have properties of geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas not turned out to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because in the end of the mall there were more local to sell them.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to get air out.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut up almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting up <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis urban
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water from the inside.
You're waiting for the early next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest thing that I have designed -- I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen of the access to a dozen straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the existing streets, creating 12 early blocks similar in size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of <unk> <unk> with straight lines, and this will change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural <unk>
So we <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the inside.
And it also responds to local norms that make a higher density in the upper levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to give the community the space space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can get up and <unk> and make activities such as running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as an objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as all the new girls.
I had a lot of bright hair very brilliant hair and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of Aspen until I was going to get my sinister friend plan.
I became a time after the <unk> of school. It was a bit late and I hid in the bathroom bath at girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom and I took the table of my teacher in high grades.
And then, I did.
I had the grades of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All of them --  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of those rows from <unk> and I was at a row of that, just because of being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt pretty good about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got me.
It was all the obvious <unk>
I would never get me.
But most of all, I'm going to tell you the reason why I was concerned that this little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
I'm going to make it <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause number one in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> because we take it or long or the sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no Mae <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk>
It wouldn't have king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
It wouldn't have <unk>
<unk> the high school lists of school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of how much they have all of them.
This year has been 100 years of his work -- "In the time I was looking for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> my God, all you could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forget how hard that picture.
We forgot about the relentless which it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the helix.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel physically.
When we feel interfaces, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being a member of mine, and audience, we know exactly what detail <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> are doing all of us, <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does for me to give me pleasure might give you to each other, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh creature that <unk> detects in his dish, he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion, you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the great amounts of brilliant hair and the cute little <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links to the language of their own.
When you <unk> it is in his healthier, you'll suddenly hear behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his own, then it includes those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, for the truth, a really painful. In fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> these were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us something that makes us a range of much deeper feelings and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
We're saying we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think he's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other excitement to us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman would have it.
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man, who didn't be <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, not realizing his wife, <unk>
<unk> <unk> or did it be <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents in fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> leads us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since that he sent messages to <unk> <unk> itself, for a year.
For a year every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to tell you that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge, even though we do creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of linked to it.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to do how many of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of how the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take away from your being and <unk> from what you ever do, and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, it takes your <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> which needs to <unk> <unk> you need the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is thought, right?
It seems like to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so frustrated.
What if the <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to this?
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> from the other.
We can stick with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So while we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
It's only the fictional fiction thing.
The fiction used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what you do, the sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
And the 21st of July July herd. It jumped out of the wall of Apollo 11 and he landed on the Sea of <unk>
Armstrong and invented were alone, but their presence in gray gray <unk> was the receivers of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the largest grows in the time of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which we found behind the Armstrong death, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn into our goal?
And you might also ask, why do you scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly about the <unk>
Why do I play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the crew crew flew at 40,000 miles -- / hour.
Since 1970, no human being got back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the technology we think that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure a clean energy, cure the cancer population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So what that connects to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> us and have been enriched with volcanic toys -- things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and <unk> our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they were <unk> -- I know -- I have Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of <unk> problems or even fake problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its high point without worrying about the risk, they played small investment by the ones that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term -- they have never invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have any commercial commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We will not go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are in agreement about what policies and international treated <unk> the development of an active energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the price price.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus there.
And sometimes the big problems that seemed to be, it turns out not to be.
We know from time for time to make it a result of the failure of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that women are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or the systems for storage and deal of food, but there will be enough of the bad governments.
And finally, the big problems we have sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president decides he declared the war to the cancer, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we can have it, but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> because the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it comes with those laptop.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy and <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular science of science fiction as the way of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very general belief,
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should make the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why people think that trust has been <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turned to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could be increased in others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to our view, and test polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> as nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway down.
But this is the evidence of enough?
What polls <unk> are of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at are <unk> attitudes that people are when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
I would probably be able to ask, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some, but in others not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to reverse trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official <unk> or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the class of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to make it the good judgment of the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
This is not that goal that I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not <unk>
And I think that those people who are <unk> their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart target in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worth trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see it <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do with them before I trust.
confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's difficult.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of <unk> <unk> officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they make the work of the people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
All of you know all the similar examples.
And we would get all of that, for the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were trying to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
And we were going to do the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't do it for the general people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- he says I can <unk> it without giving any explanations for it.
I carry them up and get the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of confidence and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital data, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one another, the glass of the glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how we <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers his physical body on the bottom.
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, you break the barriers.
But the two hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole body of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> with a depth of depth to detect your fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it's so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can look through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual <unk> sensor that is down from every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought them and spent things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, rather than just looking at pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so we can make it <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi -- and my collaborator <unk> we created this only <unk>
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of neurons.
And to program digitally digitally released the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can show it physically and physically and the famous shot of Michael Jordan -- you can play it as a physical reality the sometimes we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks this is an actual experience and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us that we have to take advantage of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you were going to have that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to give a school for athletes with all expenses down.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution they believed firmly that there was just a direct path to <unk> a safe and good job and <unk>
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer in the time.
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start to be <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But in any adult you would give you the idea.
No adult I was serious.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I mean, during the rest of my life a second kind of second kind of thing was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted <unk> OK.
I put the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I did here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> comes to Chinese life.
And it's not a tremendous <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me to my <unk> habit <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me that it seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like political religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it in life in <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> "I fear the fear and the duty to make it interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of going to miss in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling like I used to feel like or powerless before.
Having a broken dream -- it's really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that consciousness is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled on my office my office took away and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought it could handle it.
But I didn't know.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought up to the <unk> it became easy just to move your head while you get the solution.
The 30 percent are the new <unk> he would say Alex, and so I looked like, she was right.
You start working later, they go home later, it has children later, until death goes later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to get <unk>
But shortly after that, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about her life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
Also, the best moment to work in Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit head after what they do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex -- they were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to the age without being before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> they love a dream -- a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years.
This means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give their life to have happened to the time of 30 and <unk>
People from about 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we do.
We know more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of the top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are an critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
The journalists would tell you names <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
A <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when they give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen.
And then every single day, <unk> <unk> kind of like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship.
Or they say, "All say that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They all run and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned up the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one that was going to be stop, so sometimes I think I was married with my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but they don't <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of us will start a career, choose a city, choose a partner, and have two children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is much harder and stressful doing everything from once to the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red medical cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> are looking at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in their own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or on the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I was the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper I lived with a boyfriend, which was more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living with a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often going to get into our <unk> but then she got up with her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I just had to buy a new book on <unk> and I had spent the entire morning in the front morning with his many relationships, but then he got to see the empty space that goes after the words "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as just sitting while the decade <unk> of Emma passed on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that I was aware of that identity crisis and <unk> capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital involves identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try and try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't tell -- that, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I would be able to explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that they get together with friends with the similar minds are limited to who you know what you know about, how do you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come up almost always comes out of his closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then meet the head of your neighbor is a way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not less important, she believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was really true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma would soon lead to his family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had arrived.
You may think that 30 percent is better to sit in mind than the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live right now, or you get to you, now when everyone on Facebook, they start walking towards <unk> not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be an conscious choice of who and what they want instead to do it will work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk> to you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the community of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out of the airport from Los Angeles, who come somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fit in your trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day -- <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital, using your weak bonds -- you choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the work comes back, they will <unk> grades.
What I called me was that <unk> was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going to be so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of things you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We were studying teachers <unk> working in neighborhoods really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the more effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies -- ask yourself, what about these marketers are going to maintain their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts emerged a feature like an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to their future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the testing evidence -- even safety that felt children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West America, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, how little it knows about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination in kids?
What should I do to teach kids a strong ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just don't keep ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly related to or is even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford at Stanford by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more prone to <unk> when they were <unk> because they don't believe that it is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my <unk> <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a abroad it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each one of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy literacy alone.
The first 200 will allow you to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree. tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
This is a flag like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> from remember, because a tree is pretty an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two together, and it gets very hot.
Three times together, that's a lot of fire.
Put fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, getting care is <unk>
So we've been about 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred pounds -- which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, it's been turned out.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I come to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, saw the magician magician together.
The movie took their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and take a magic notation.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children into a sort of industrial <unk> <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> was a guy of metal and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
I would have magical shoes to beat the <unk> for the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he also had a son at that time.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So he was played in the room and was impressed as a mom and was impressed as a mom on her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be topics of value, and they would be <unk>
I would have the feeling that Luke got one to an army to <unk>
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How does it make Dorothy their film?
By doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, OK?
Why is there so much of the capital force to force force into the movies for our kids, and so little about the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this war.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first blind question, I really expected them to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest has done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on <unk> to <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dangerous animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand up to the <unk> of Disney to anyone of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they kids, they are not really their target audience.
They make a phenomenal job when you teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and beautiful as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the days continues to come up in classic after classic <unk> every one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who make a young girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book of comics, and in the <unk> of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the movie, there is more than a female character than it will be.
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some time in the film?
Their conversations are about something more besides the boy than you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet quite rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what is a Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen to the <unk> test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women are hiding during the crisis of <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to the front door, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular films how many of them believe they have actors in the ground.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percent that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to look at this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one in the United States, he says it's been sexually sexually in their life.
I don't think it's the fault.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to beat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same world, we found this world and this very impressive statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our <unk> like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we have to show our kids to have a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite de Star <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress here.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I read to my <unk> Go and struggle just and more stories where their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked to look at was to take the sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to almost 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea fortune had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when you use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked view, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Ottoman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Ottoman East, there was this great renaissance of old art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, I saw it right on the side of <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk>
And I'll try to find it at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with Egyptians who are doing <unk> <unk> you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation to look for.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date back from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a shop of <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones that used in the hopes of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes from the Ottoman Ottoman Ottoman <unk>
We also have evidence of an elite event that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we were going to go to the place in a close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians on the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So you know, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas happen really started in 1984 B.C.
And it certainly puts it out of marine <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now we were <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> career, and they go in the direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they are going a lot.
And they collide in front of the door of his house.
There's <unk> flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays out of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, <unk> the line.
And what there is to be the lobby, or what there is the other side of the door, and you look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
A brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's talking about.
They can feel their blue <unk> <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go into the mouth.
And they went along and enter their living room.
It's already in the room, and doing maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, clothing, dancing on his middle <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been tied up with a yellow bricks and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that has done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of the <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
You know, the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> entire poems in just minutes.
You know, to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people should be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Raleigh who had come from England and he has one of the better <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a <unk>
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition they say they have normal memory.
We have trained ourselves to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old old techniques invented a half thousand years ago on Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their penicillin, and that academics were used for <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and brilliant ones, even though a little bit <unk> he said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist,
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, no, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of cards and live television on national television.
That would show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something wouldn't you?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it does not work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> And he was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the way back, I read a lot of treated about the memory of writing something about 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not such as rare as it might seem like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed also cognitive too.
As we almost don't have any need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where are still passionate people who are passionate about this idea of a predatory memory and <unk> memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there's a skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it a brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and a significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, you know, <unk> their brains while we were using numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions they were <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament in the <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race where every year appears someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word.
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what do you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different than <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. There's no relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> when they go home to work.
You probably had some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago at Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story does this like this: There was a poet called <unk> I went to a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring it up to a <unk> you get to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, <unk> his poem of memory, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> room was <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them all all all of us, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where you were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where every single one was sitting on every day.
I took the family of his hand <unk> where they were his loved ones between the rubble.
What we were going to take in the moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions or a word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and special spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely that they find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you were going to tell you that if you were sitting on the horse he was sitting on the horse, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first tested of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it of memory, the same way that he would have made it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're in the door of your house.
And I come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to say is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they play in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is like the speakers -- <unk> <unk> the <unk> not a word for word, who is going to confuse it -- it's typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills and had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an boring.
But seriously, it's like a lot of people sitting there taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a lot of fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really stuck with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a little bit of safety covered with tape and leaving only two <unk> because the fact is the worst enemy of a memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was <unk>
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. <unk> who work work.
Because they are based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on how we focus in.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
So we had a sort of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not going to be <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no proportion.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I did -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side. We're going to be so <unk> that we don't even be able to process it in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so you know, just a place <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a mathematician that gave the living room.
And there were all the time watching the television -- so every time I was coming from my room to the bathroom, everyone turned to me, and every time I got to me, and I would come back in a few.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> I hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those feelings that I felt, that is the power of architecture. Because architecture is not about mathematics, and of the areas of areas -- but from those connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans pass 90 percent of their time underground.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines it in ways that we don't even notice us.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as well as based on a building two years ago on the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments, always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> Library in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, you have a <unk> it has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that they leave <unk> which is about communicating with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
And we gave it so much, that we get away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you think that we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to connect to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we go through the course of the back and go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, at scale.
Something really hard.
So we zoom in to the '80s, and we start to incorporate those symbols.
And then we put it back into the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added some new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned it in a decade, that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up until the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic beings.
These fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They are easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we <unk> memories of other places.
I know very good, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to swing the creation again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques to be a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I will say, academic and public and public in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in two percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
All the world wanted one, and she was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and very quickly learned that those forms meant that these forms of culture and computers.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did was made the world's major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these ways, they had culture and status.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new tradition happened with another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very accurate to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find out buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years ago, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when he applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, to get to be in both extreme extremes in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a break.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked like exactly the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building has been built today, first of the Internet to look for the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there are no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using <unk> words and complicated drawings, and you're no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't have seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave it for the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a <unk> historical brick of red brick based on ideas of what is a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because ultimately we'll be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream swimming on the East East <unk> in New York, and I raise half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, it's no one customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to happen.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to do it.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very cool -- typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his perspective.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
I want all their friends to do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for surveillance -- "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old.
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though her mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells you and what his friends, or my friends in school say, you don't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, does it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 books.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, and so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There is just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of people who have and the types of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is.
What is the top of the life of someone in front of what is normal in a single context, every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be individuals that are good people.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their look, the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to work.
Six of 10 girls prefer to do something because they think you don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as a range of society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the singing debates to participate in the classroom of classroom because they don't want to call the attention for its physical form.
One of five are not attending classes at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the Christmas season, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically if you don't think you're going to be <unk> <unk> a smaller note at the average of your fellow fellow people who don't care about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and this phenomenon has been
And it gives up regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So, to make it clear of course, we're talking about how you see -- not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with some self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, participate in more diets that you didn't have to take them into a food disorder that can take you to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are in greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all over this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetic relationships to early ages and without protection and <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing to the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would it be like <unk>
This potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that are still our children not just going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are crucial starting to get anyone willing to provide a personal quality education that will work.
A education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires every one of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
The status of the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as companies, to change truly our culture, so that our children will grow up to grow all of their own person, save the individuality, the <unk> the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you are never <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats away from a distance. What would it mean to her if he was released from that voice to be released in his own, that he was <unk> by not having long legs, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for it if we were <unk> this and thought about their potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images of our culture is <unk>
But let's take our children true.
You know, the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They will support self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age today, they become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November from 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially the innocent thing, but being imprisoned by other charges in company company started planning attacks on 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters for the United Nations.
So fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 of 1993 in the World Trade Center, was not able to do it.
Later it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving American mother, teacher school teacher from the two did all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most of the Muslims, they get to meet.
And I saw that when people take time for them, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that you think we have to use all the possible media so that everyone lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point for the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet who shot his little orange light on the target and to surprise you, especially mine, all of me, all of me, all the target broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a <unk> they are <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable with someone was already <unk> and getting to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white thing, but it will be the new class of class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills, to say it would be <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like his race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put to test my way to think, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group were <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the guys who we had made friendship, friendship, was Jewish age.
I took several days out to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life was made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job, in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by <unk> all gay gay were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the simplest and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people differently, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast to the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation -- they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure that I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in trouble.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has been enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy, you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts without sense, like rejection the actions of my father.
And with this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that was built in their minds.
This is an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It's got emotions, anger and happiness.
You've got memories, as a moments of your childhood that you project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a <unk> voice, in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all of you live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the minds and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a internal movie -- you, tea and you.
There is nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have a real awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
<unk> is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we were going to have to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is an objective of it.
The consciousness, by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior. The neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but never never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind in great work that presented Nancy Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness.
But in a sense, those are the hard problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, not making that the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a internal <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do you operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- they're all questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain like a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific scientist.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that will work for a long time, hit me on the wall, looking for a theory of consciousness for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons.
I think we were at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations chain, we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no problem hard to consciousness.
The whole idea of the urban subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> behaviors of the brain, and so we study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time we left it, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they look very fundamental -- and that's what the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of how fundamental it is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical burden as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- space, mass, <unk> -- then because of logic -- you have to use the list.
The natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not the object of science, right?
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space, the mass, the physical processes.
And physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not just humans, the dogs, mice, flies, the microbes -- the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when you think "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some precursor to your consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think such <unk>
In part this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuous with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful reason to find fundamental laws that we think of thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex, like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, your simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree high degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a half a half of information, as a kind of significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the other, microbes, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness level of zero.
In fact, it gives a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers often have looked at the physics is curiously abstract than the physics is curiously abstract than the physics is curiously abstract than the physics and the philosophers and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where comes out of the fire of <unk>
From vision <unk> the equations of physics can be done as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
In this vision, consciousness is what puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, vision <unk> has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had a consciousness, then it should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think thinking about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has an processing of complicated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
And finally, you can ask for the collective awareness of the <unk> the planet.
So Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, a <unk> group like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a collective collective consciousness, a internal movie for this whole group of TED <unk> different from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea that the second one is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a serious awareness theory.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find out.
To understand consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at all.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was excited with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to be <unk> for a community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem.
She actually hasn't gotten nothing."
I went to school, I had good notes. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the middle class of 11 <unk> and a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you're going to give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in chairs in the wheels, they talk about things that are <unk> at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this boy had had experiences with disability with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't know about it, and it's not fault.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people, we are there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this chair in the wheels, and you probably are waiting for them to tell you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have lied about disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you quite remarkable.
It's not a bad thing to do, and it doesn't make a remarkable thing.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before it <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> legs of carbon.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term <unk> <unk> because I would put a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will be able to have the benefits of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, why is my life, it might be worse.
I could be that one.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability with people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
I had a few things.
But the things that we do. It's not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by the so-called <unk> social model that tells us that we are more likely because of the society that we live in that we live in because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you like a 1974.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by somebody else.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am so lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a climb of stairs hasn't done it to become a <unk>
Never.         <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names for tomorrow.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 degree in a high school school is not not a little bit surprised that your new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see is augmented reality and football reality with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of reality, they actually think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality augmented reality to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running by the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man for 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> all of his being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I had some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine coming up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
And a moment. It was a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> at the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> George <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
They want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk> <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many people know.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, good.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a <unk> video crossing across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before running and making a <unk> What's the experience of a fan
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> by launching the ball at the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and the owners look at what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a brief test about technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put rooms in the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to your group and you see their next step shown in front of you, in a plastic theory, in a plastic Mark <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or if you memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people that are down.
You also get the data from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones have <unk>
This is <unk> to good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field of field.
They put the ball and <unk>
You get a <unk> <unk> all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your Norden bombsight -- you know, that a defense behind you is going to <unk>   You don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They were going to go into the area of protection.
Another <unk> gives you that there's a open.
You get the <unk> but you get off.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the career.
You get <unk> it takes <unk> runs and <unk>
The real audience and the fans have followed the car from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to get lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
They want to be in the field, they want to be in the room.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, as always, as you are always, as always, as you are.
Thank you.
I recently got away from 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> in California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the country -- the southern county of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful San views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden Corporation was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer <unk> who had to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical or practical or <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, as the each of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every four to five seconds, the body hits about the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which <unk> your vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that not, usually <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method will be aware of the <unk> death to the <unk>
This is the cord.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people were for before you get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the bottom time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you the joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those of us who <unk> the suicide, but as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials are veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the last 22 of Julius last year to get a guy called a particular subject to be able to be able to run on the window near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an official <unk> <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before the New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
They stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of kind and intelligent guy in New Jersey just had to take her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing -- because the next day, the rabbi rabbi was called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
<unk> damage suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family or a friend or someone would love to be <unk>
What do you do?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, not only you have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand it.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
You know, you get to the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> and social and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell her friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but I actually see more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> like disappeared that night.
At the next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car car was down in the bridge.
One witness had been seen from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go out.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March March of March 2005, I wrote a radio call for a particular subject to be able to put up on the sidewalk near the north.
And I had a <unk> on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he walked away from immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his mind that day to go back on that lane and give it a new opportunity.
When Kevin came up with Kevin <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it happen to do, and gave the hope and the life of the other <unk>
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I'm <unk>
I stopped talking to you and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing <unk> the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin remains with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly built.
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I really want to be in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> When I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I know what I had to do.
Today, Kevin is an active father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide isn't just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, would give me the opportunity to meet it.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain of it.
The general thing is done by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded to me and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved with, just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And over that time, I would get my hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely terrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped in the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they left on the side, they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not just connects to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be used to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There are help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner mind, you know what you are, and a question: How do you stand on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt was that finally had the dream that I had had since a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner myself.
For complicated reasons, which I will go later later, when I look at this picture, I think, you know, you get it, you know, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning to do.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo -- what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how do you <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I think that will be a bad thing, but why the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom and dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as a little bit <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk>
He told me that if I was <unk> she was taken away from the <unk> and <unk> and I won that night, I won in <unk> I won <unk> and he was a third <unk> between the top of 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that his first work was from Queen of beauty of women, but I do can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I was <unk> in the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She was also obsessed with me when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand, doing the most sophisticated surgeries and safe surgeries and safe.
So in the United States, it was necessary to get surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or being able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
All of a sudden, my fears looked <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but that, <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global conviction for the Day of <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
So these are neurogenesis, thinking: Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer than 20 than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Would you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, to thank all my <unk>
My father's network in particular, to my parents in particular, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I have come to young women who have been <unk> and a few times, when they were called me and told me that his parents couldn't follow it, I would take my mom and he would say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that task doesn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, and this is a conversation that
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education to defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, their birth won't be <unk>
He is not happy.
The neighborhood comes from their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother would get a lot to get a lot of a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, gets a sad one.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother of cars, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it grows, it is too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school to their siblings.
Until 12 years old, somehow, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into the <unk> when it comes to 13 years old, you get to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you get the code of that course honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this code code doesn't just affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a norm more of <unk> societies called <unk>
You're supposed to be a good girl should be very humble and very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and that embrace the decisions of his father and his mother and people's decisions even if they don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If you were very young, you have to take it down.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the next one, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter like this.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I took my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she went on, when she was four and a half years old and the <unk> in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I should be <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in a lot of developed countries, but in the poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies -- is a great event for a life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when you were <unk> the form of a sudden, Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document in any row.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me different <unk>
And all of these values, I've been trying to go on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to the school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the ownership of the BBC, was offered her for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine from October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and I read my ear to my wife -- "I should be <unk> by what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't you get <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right way and God <unk>
These few words were going to be a lot for me, and I didn't start to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pain and strong headaches -- because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get it right. Please do not be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl at 16 years.
<unk> when he didn't end his task.
They fight with their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is in special about my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't wonder what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today here about brain science, I did before join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a brain surgery.
You are still as smart or not?
It's not going to be <unk> you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what number we take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I did nothing -- would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and you mix out of chemicals, and try to get them to go with life.
I have been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to try to get the <unk> dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try and try with <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the <unk> <unk> my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, and I had a typical chemical dose for a man of order, and I was surprised to see how to make my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past have met several guys like this, or perhaps some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem with the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do, and I have to be better at the men.
What was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and females and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
You know, I think almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference -- how do you get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Jews and <unk> see things differently.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking about <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> actually <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring together these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that made for two different groups that have in neuroscience.
They both used technology, MRI image is using functional MRI to represent the brain. You can see the brain scanning made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks an image.
The column of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left, and you see that the difference is almost about you.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost about.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves in the visual fields of <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions in the video sequences of the video.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain brain information is going to show you to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This is going to be left with us.
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it is believed in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems systems that are available today, and their resolution was a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets is with larger magnets but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of bright and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the same, and <unk> of FM rates in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, they were <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns, <unk> to the radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the political radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide into layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity.
We're going to be able to put our ideas into direct digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease.
We have a few options more than opening up this door.
Anyway, you pick a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay lectures.
I think we all have <unk>
His plan is probably to tell you to any person for the first time he loves him or tell somebody who's pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you're doing in life.
It's a very difficult conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have gone out of that room is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it to happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote <unk> <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> and I would get my head back, I would ask me a little bit, I would ask you a little kid, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would be quiet silence at the table.
My jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother took a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> in it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence but this time was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" and I did that <unk>
And so I took it down a little bit and I went down and I went down and my backs and my backs a little girl in four years with a pink dress and staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took it up deep down, again, I put out of <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something messy.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Now, I'm a little bit more than a girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite friends, it's <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it just "Ah, ah, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easy conversation for anyone ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl from the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like you feel in a closet.
This is how my George, is not different to you or your tea or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons why I was going to go out of my best, and it was harder to get out of it, but this is the <unk> it's hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has been declared in online banking is harder than telling you it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We have to leave that together and make it hard with respect to what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make you feel security, or at least more security than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are made up -- a bloodline.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and shoes and <unk> shoes.
It was not going to be the militant <unk> to fight every four years who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> my sister gay, and the moving only one muscle is the most scary than ever done.
My family, my little strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so much time, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill you.
And one of my most memorable emails was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were born, they knew that I was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and I finally came out of a where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women going, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in expect to show desperately her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find out of the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you are.
It's like the hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone that I would have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what involves going out of any <unk> is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also do it.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never get away from that.
And some of you can get out wounded wounded -- because of what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you meet in a dark room, <unk> a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Exactly.
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think of it is so interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When he <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a critical to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
First we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the Earth of the Earth or intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth of the Earth, would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be with the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There is only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a and = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a T, with the diversity of possible future future, Yeah, even an impending period of a future time.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
You know, the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to be more sensitive to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection <unk> between entropy and intelligence.
What if intelligent behavior is not only associated with production production in the long term, but it actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy long-term entropy in whatever system you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to get multiple tests of animal intelligence, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it would have been able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for his balance to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotics and human technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see that we see a lot of new connections on a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the network <unk>
This same capacity of network network also has applications in health care, and in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy of <unk> <unk> in a wild series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk management ability to have massive applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of cognitive cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of us take a single equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term use of the term <unk> the work -- there was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that would be <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of 2005 to the reverse reverse.
It's not that the machines are becoming smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
And they often ask me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, this is the following: intelligence has to be a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the bottom of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, what points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go through in front of them, and they prefer a little bit of that light that will us.
The data gathered in Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are empty or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this saddle-shaped of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I am not a scientist in the weather, no <unk>
But we study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the market.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more looking for planets like the Earth, more like our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet only discovered and the planets that we know better, the from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the sun, it can be considered a potentially <unk> world, demonstrated this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and in part, is why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking its surface to look for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> the <unk> like the <unk> mission -- they take samples from the <unk> atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offering not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> they remind us about the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places and higher <unk> on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization, of Mars and other planets would end up with a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> the Earth.
For a lot that I like to like the current exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic would have to tell us that the <unk> actually will have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration <unk> and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand and improve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi had, so I had to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of planets that are <unk> this development.
It's like you like to think that only makes it <unk> we will save us from ourselves, but global preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at hostile environments on Mars for human presence for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the most easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table where he had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to happen to night because I had a early flight in Europe to the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances right there.
I'm a sense of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> the levels.
And when I arrived at the <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was going to show that bad things.
Or at least, if you are bad things -- that you know, the probability of it is a total catastrophe as well.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a bit embarrassed to talk to him I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called t-shirt.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what came wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, they would take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over over thousands of years, to make track of the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where the fish, the <unk> trees -- where the tribes are <unk> and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask whether somebody actually made the experiment -- they had the <unk> sense of <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys the car <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook together with the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For his passport, a particular thought.
For their reading, a particular <unk>
If you get a place and they are <unk> with it -- your things always will be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards license of your credit cards, <unk> <unk> <unk> by email themselves so they're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases them.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
